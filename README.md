# BANK-LOAN-ANALYSIS-WITH-PYTHON

## Overview
This project delivers an end-to-end bank loan analysis using Python, focusing on real financial data to evaluate loan portfolio health, business KPIs, and risk factors for a US-based bank. All steps—business requirements documentation, KPI reporting, data cleaning, and visualization—are covered in detail.

## Key Objectives
- Track total loan applications and monthly/application trends.
- Analyze funded vs. received amounts and repayment performance.
- Segment and compare Good Loans vs. Bad Loans by repayment.
- Compute KPIs: funded amount, received amount, average interest rate.
- Visualize insights: monthly trends, regional analysis, loan term/purpose, employee length, ownership status, repayment patterns.

## Dataset Description
- 24 columns, ~38,500 records representing loan applications, approvals, repayments, and detailed customer/loan features.
- Key columns: loan_id, state, application_type, employee_length, title, grade, home_ownership, issue_date, last_pymnt_date, loan_status, amount, interest_rate, dti, purpose, repayment.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- Markdown for documenting workflow and insights

## Project Workflow
1. **Business Requirements**: Documented in markdown, derived from typical banking BRDs.
2. **KPI Definition**: Total applications, funded/received amounts, average interest rates, Good vs. Bad loan metrics.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Type conversion, handling missing values, reviewing summary statistics.
4. **Exploratory Analysis**: Loan performance by category, time, region, ownership, etc.
5. **Visualizations**: Bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps, pie charts to explain all findings.
6. **Reporting**: All steps annotated and explained for non-technical stakeholders.

## Key Visualizations
- Loan application/funding trends (monthly, regional)
- Loan status (good/bad) ratios and repayment comparisons
- Purpose and term breakdowns
- Heatmaps and time series for advanced insight

## Results & Insights
- Identify top factors influencing loan repayment and default.
- Quantified bank performance via clear KPIs and breakdowns.
- Actionable recommendations for risk/revenue optimization.

## How to Run
1. Download the dataset and Jupyter notebook (.ipynb).
2. Run the notebook from start to finish in an Anaconda/Jupyter environment.
3. All required libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly) should be installed in advance.
4. Outputs appear as code, markdown explanations, and rich interactive charts.
